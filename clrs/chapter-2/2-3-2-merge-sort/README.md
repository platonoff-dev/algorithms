# Merge Sort Implementation

This directory contains the implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm as described in Chapter 2, Section 3.2 of the CLRS (Introduction to Algorithms) book.

## Algorithm

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the two sorted halves to produce the sorted array.

## Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(n log n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
