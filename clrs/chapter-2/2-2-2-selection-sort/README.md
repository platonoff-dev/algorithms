# Selection Sort

### Problem
Consider sorting $n$ numbers stored in array $A$ by first finding the smallest element
of $A$ and exchanging it with the element in $A[1]$. Then find the second smallest
element of $A$, and exchange it with $A[2]$. Continue in this manner for the first $n-1$
elements of $A$. Write pseudocode for this algorithm, which is known as selection
sort. What loop invariant does this algorithm maintain? Why does it need to run
for only the first $n-1$ elements, rather than for all $n$ elements? Give the best-case
and worst-case running times of selection sort in $\Theta $-notation.


## Complexity

- Time Complexity: $O(n^2)$
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$
